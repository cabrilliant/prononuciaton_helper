# Pronunciation Helper
This plugin will show official pronunciation of words in dialogue with npcs.

Currently, it will only show the pronunciation in brackets during NPC or player dialogue.
All pronunciations are taken from runescape official pronunciation guide: https://runescape.wiki/w/Transcript:Pronunciation_guide


Planned features:
- Right click lookup "Pronounce" for nps with eligible names(configurable option)
- Perhaps some hotkey to replace word fully with pronunciation in chatbox when held.
- Any requested features.
