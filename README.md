# Pronunciation Helper
This plugin will show official pronunciation of words in dialogue with npcs.

Currently, it will only show the pronunciation in brackets during NPC or player dialogue.
All pronunciations are taken from Runescape official pronunciation guide: https://runescape.wiki/w/Transcript:Pronunciation_guide

- Always Show pronunciation: If enabled, the pronunciation will always be shown in dialogue. If disabled, it will only show when the ronunciation Hotkey key is held down.

- Pronunciation Hotkey: A key to be held down that will replace the qualifying word with its pronunciation directly, as opposed to in brackets beside the word

For example, if you disable always show pronunciation, when the hotkey is held, the word will be replaced dynamically with its pronunciation in pronunciation colour untill released.

Planned features:
- Right click lookup "Pronounce" for nps with eligible names(configurable option)
- Any requested features.


Notes:
This plugin is likely not compatible with other plugins that modify dialogue.
